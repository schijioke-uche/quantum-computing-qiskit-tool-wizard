               [   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION   ]

The Apache License, Version 2.0, is a permissive open-source license that allows users to freely use, modify, distribute, and sublicense the software, whether in source or compiled form. It grants a perpetual, royalty-free copyright and patent license from all contributors, provided that proper attribution and notices are maintained in the distributed code. If any changes are made to the original code, they must be clearly stated, and derivative works should carry appropriate documentation or notice files.

Users are not allowed to use the original contributors’ trademarks, service marks, or product names without explicit permission. Contributions submitted to the licensed work are automatically covered under the same license unless otherwise stated. However, if the user initiates patent litigation against a contributor over the software, their patent license is terminated immediately. Additionally, while users may offer warranties or support for redistributed works, they must do so independently and assume full responsibility for any liabilities.

The license also includes a disclaimer of warranty and limits liability, stating that the software is provided "as is" without any guarantees of performance or suitability. Contributors are not liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the software. Finally, to apply the Apache License to a project, the standard boilerplate notice should be included in the code files, referencing the license URL and stating that the software is governed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
